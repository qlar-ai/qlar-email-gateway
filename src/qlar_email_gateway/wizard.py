"""First-run setup: ask for the database details, write them to `.env`, prove they work.

Installing the gateway and starting it should be the whole job. Copying `.env.example`,
remembering which variable names the loader expects, and discovering a typo hours later
when the first query fails is work that a handful of prompts can do instead.

So a start with no usable configuration asks, writes the answers to `.env`, and runs one
query against the database before going any further. The answers are written to the file
precisely so that this happens exactly once: the next start — a restart, a systemd unit, a
replaced container — reads the file and never asks again. `--init` asks anyway, for the
day the password rotates or the database moves.

None of this is mandatory. A `.env` written by hand, or environment variables set by a
container, still take precedence and the prompts never appear; and without a terminal to
ask on, the old configuration error is printed exactly as before. The prompts are a
convenience for a human at a console, never a new requirement for automation.
